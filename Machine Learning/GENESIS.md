## ABOUT PROJECT - 
Keeping track of dietary habits and analysing nutritional content can be challenging for individuals
seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Traditional methods lack efficiency and accuracy, making it
difficult to obtain comprehensive nutritional insights from meals. To address these challenges, our
hackathon project aims to develop a solution that seamlessly identifies food items from images and
provides detailed nutritional information, enabling users to make informed dietary choices.
 


## Tech Stack used-
Image Classification and Object Detection: Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to
accurately identify and categorize food items in images.
• Computer Vision: Preprocessing images and extracting features to enhance the accuracy of image
recognition.
• Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn
hierarchical features and accurately classify food items.
• React and Material-UI (MUI): Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly frontend for capturing
images and viewing nutritional insights.
• Mongo dB and Firebase(optional):Creating secure authentication, storing calories and dietary
preferences.
